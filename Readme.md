## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google API
- Wikipedia API
- Materialize CSS
- Modals

## Usage:
To view the code learning app, open the 'index.html' file in your web browser.

## User Story 
As A new student
I WANT to learn basic coding from examples and test them out
SO THAT I can get familiar with coding basics 

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I go to the homepage
THEN I am presented with three coding languages to learn from and each section has a written description, an example image, and a ''learn more'' button
WHEN I click the "learn more" button
THEN I am directed to that specific language 
WHEN I am on each language's page
THEN I am presented with four examples, a description, a screenshot of the deployed code, the raw code, and a quiz for each subject
WHEN I click the quiz button
THEN I am directed to Google to test what I learned
WHEN I click the ''next lesson'' button
THEN I am directed to the next coding language to learn
